# Handwritten Letter Recognition

In this project, we delve into the world of recognizing handwritten letters using deep learning models implemented with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn libraries.

## The Challenge

Our mission is clear: develop and train a robust deep learning model to accurately recognize handwritten letters. Our weapon of choice? The famous EMNIST dataset.

## Let's Get Started

Our journey unfolds in three parts, each harnessing the power of a different library:

### Part 1: TensorFlow Takes the Stage

Here, we:
- Prepare the EMNIST dataset
- Construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Train our model
- Measure its accuracy

### Part 2: PyTorch Joins the Fray

In this chapter, we:
- Prepare the EMNIST dataset once more
- Craft a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch
- Train the model
- Gauge its accuracy

## Unveiling the Results

Behold! Our findings are encapsulated in the results directory, showcasing:
- Confusion matrices
- Model accuracy
- Training and testing loss

## The Verdict

This project serves as a platform for a comparative analysis between TensorFlow and PyTorch in the realm of handwritten letter recognition.
