**Handwritten Letter Recognition

This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten letters using the tensorflow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn libraries.

The goal of this project is to train a neural network to recognize letters in images and output the corresponding character.
