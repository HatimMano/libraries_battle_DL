# Handwritten Letter Recognition

In this project, we embark on a journey to recognize handwritten letters using deep learning models implemented with PyTorch and scikit-learn libraries.

## The Challenge

Our mission is clear: develop and train a robust deep learning model to accurately recognize handwritten letters. Our weapon of choice? The famous EMNIST dataset.

## Let's Get Started

Our journey unfolds in two parts, each harnessing the power of a different library:

### Part 1: PyTorch Takes the Lead

Here, we:
- Prepare the EMNIST dataset
- Craft a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch
- Train our model
- Measure its accuracy

## Unveiling the Results

Behold! Our findings are encapsulated in the results directory, showcasing:
- Confusion matrices
- Model accuracy
- Training and testing loss

## The Verdict

This project serves as a platform for exploring the capabilities of PyTorch in the realm of handwritten letter recognition.
